## Question: What qualities make for a good movie and should Microsoft produce them?
  * What effect do ratings, reviews, movie length have on a movies success?
  * How does Microsoft's operations compare, financilay, to those of movie producers?
## Process & Tools Used:
### From included files:
  *  RT, IMDB, TMDB, and TN 
### Other
  * Web Scraping: Wikipedia and Yahoo Finance
  * YFinance: Yahoo Finance library
## Findings 
### I analyzed movies by three metrics: 
  * Ratings (G,PG,Pg-13...)
  * Reveiws (on scale of 1 to 10) 
  * Length (in minutes)
### All three metrics occur across all movies and are universal, definable, and/or group-able  
### My first angle was to look at ratings and see how they effeccted box office sale, which is the best avalable proxy for success. All of the neccesary data is avalable via the RT tables and with some clearing and organizing show the following.
